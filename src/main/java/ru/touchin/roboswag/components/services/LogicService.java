 * Created by Gavriil Sitnikov on 10/01/2016.
 * Service which holds interface to all application's logic objects and methods.
 * Any part of application should interact with some part of logic via this interface.
 * If it is Service, Activity, Fragment or view then it should bind itself to that service first then get service and logic bridge from IBinder.
 * If it is BroadcastReceiver then it should start service which can bind to that service or just send some intent to that service.
